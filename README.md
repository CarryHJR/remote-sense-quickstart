### current method

The Eearly-Fusion architecture concatenated the two patches before passing them through the net-work, treating them as different color channels.

The Siamese architecture processed both images separately at first by iden-tical branches of the network with shared structure and pa-rameters, merging the two branches only after the convolu-tional layers of the network.

The tranditional method is also popular, like "iterative slow feature analysis"

### current method

Personlly, although so some papers are proposed every year, the best methods are raw deep netural network like SENet 154, EfficientNet, to name a few.
